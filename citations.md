Here is a file where everyone can say what/where they used AI or third party code for.

Jonathan:

Uses: Cursor Pro for students (can get with .edu email)
I used AI for some of the Food and User routes. IU wrote out a few of the routes myself (for mockAPI and the Route controller) to give it a reference, so it can replicate my style, then told it top write x routs using my style. I do this a good amount, using older code I wrote so AI can replicate it. I'll just tell you what i prompted by PR.

I did use the individual as reference for alot of the code i wrote myself, 

Food routes (PR1) - "Here is some code i wrote for Food and User, make these routes (list of routes that we had in readme)"

Make Data Persistent (PR2) - This PR was msotly written by me, i did give ai our class structure for it to make some mock data.

Add AfterAll teardown to unit tests (PR3) - Written by me

Add more test cases to endpoints (PR4)- I'd say about half test cases were mine, after i did a few I prompted cursor to write more in "x" format (valid, invalid, atypical) structure. Since i already had a few done, it was able to use the ones i've written as context
